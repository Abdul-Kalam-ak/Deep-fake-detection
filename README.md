# Deep-fake-detection
An ML model to detect deep faked video and images
DeepFake Detection Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect deepfake videos and images. Deepfakes refer to media (videos or images) that have been manipulated or generated using artificial intelligence, often making it difficult to distinguish from authentic content. The purpose of this model is to help identify such manipulated media and contribute to the efforts in combating misinformation.

Features
Deepfake Detection: The model uses state-of-the-art techniques to analyze videos and images, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of deepfake manipulation.

High Accuracy: Trained on a diverse dataset, the model aims for high accuracy in distinguishing between authentic and manipulated media.

Easy Integration: The codebase is designed to be easily integrated into existing applications or workflows, making it accessible for various use cases.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
scikit-learn
